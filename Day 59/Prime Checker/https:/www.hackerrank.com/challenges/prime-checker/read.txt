You are given a class Solution and its main method in the editor. Your task is to create a class Prime. The class Prime should contain a single method checkPrime.

The locked code in the editor will call the checkPrime method with one or more integer arguments. You should write the checkPrime method in such a way that the code prints only the prime numbers.

Please read the code given in the editor carefully. Also please do not use method overloading!

Note: You may get a compile time error in this problem due to the statement below:

  BufferedReader br=new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(in));
This was added intentionally, and you have to figure out a way to get rid of the error.

Input Format

There are only five lines of input, each containing one integer.
